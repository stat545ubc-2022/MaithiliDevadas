This repository is created to complete exploratory data analysis: milestone 1 and 2.
The repository currently contains exploratory analysis of variables in the dataset 'cancer_sample'. Codes from the 'dplyr', 'ggpplot', 'forcats', 'broom'package and so on have primarily been used.
The goal for this exploratory analysis to understand whether nuclear features of cancer cells can be used to determine whether the diagnosis is malignant 
or benign. These tests can be very useful in the pre-screening stages. 

Milestone1:
For this milestone we formed our research questions and explored the relationships between different variables. We created different visualisations using packages mainly constituting of 'dplyr' and 'ggplot'.

Milestone2:
For this milestone we carried out tasks to 'tidy' and 'untidy' our data based on our requirements. Through this we learnt the importance of structuring our data in the right way. We further used commands from the forcats() package to reorder our data based on our needs. In the next task, we created linear models to understand the relationship between an independent and dependent variable. The last task involved reading and writing data by using commands such as here().
