This repository is created to complete exploratory data analysis: milestone 1 and 2.
The repository currently contains exploratory analysis of variables in the dataset 'cancer_sample'. Codes from the 'dplyr', 'ggpplot', 'forcats', 'broom'package and so on have primarily been used.
The goal for this exploratory analysis to understand whether nuclear features of cancer cells can be used to determine whether the diagnosis is malignant 
or benign. These tests can be very useful in the pre-screening stages.
